	abstract = {Turbulence strongly influenced by a stable density stratification is studied experimentally, numerically and theoretically. This type of turbulence is encountered in the atmosphere and Oceans in an intermediate range of scales for which the Coriolis force is negligible. In a first part, the transition to turbulence of a simple flow: a pair of columnar contra-rotating vortices is studied. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) show that when the dissipation is sufficiently weak, two secondary instabilities, the shear and gravitational instabilities, develop after the zigzag instability. The characteristic length scale of the Kelvin-Helmholtz billows is of the order of the buoyancy scale. Both instabilities lead to a transition to turbulence which exhibits anisotropic spectra similar to those associated to fully developed strongly stratified turbulence. For the first time, a return to isotropy is observed for scales smaller than the Ozmidov length scale. In a second part, a fully developed turbulent flow forced with several vortex generators is studied. The experiments at the larger buoyancy Reynolds numbers have enabled for the first time to nearly reach the strongly stratified turbulent regime. These experimental results have been reproduced and extended to larger Reynolds numbers with numerical simulations forced in physical space with the same type of forcing. They reveal that the larger scale of the overturnings is of the order of the buoyancy scale. Finally, a generalisation of the 4/5s Kolmogorov law is proposed for stratified turbulence.},

Advection and refraction by such flows lead to wave scattering, redistributing IGW energy in the position‚Äìwavenumber phase space. We give a detailed description of this process by deriving a kinetic equation governing the evolution of the IGW phase-space energy density. The derivation relies on the smallness of the Rossby number characterising the geostrophic flow, which is treated as a random field with known statistics, makes no assumption of spatial scale separation, and neglects wave‚Äìwave interactions. It extends previous work restricted to near-inertial waves, barotropic flows or waves much shorter than the flow scales. The kinetic equation describes energy transfers that are restricted to IGWs with the same frequency, as a result of the time scale separation between waves and flow. We formulate the kinetic equation on the constant-frequency surface ‚Äì a double cone in wavenumber space ‚Äì using polar spherical coordinates, and we examine the form of the two scattering cross-sections involved, which quantify energy transfers between IGWs with, respectively, the same and opposite directions of vertical propagation. The kinetic equation captures both the horizontal isotropisation and the cascade of energy across scales that result from scattering. We focus our attention on the latter to assess the predictions of the kinetic equation against direct simulations of the three-dimensional Boussinesq equations, finding good agreement.},

	abstract = {The large-scale dynamics of the mid-latitude atmosphere and ocean is characterized by a timescale separation between slow balanced motion and fast inertia-gravity waves. As a result of this separation, the two types of motion interact only weakly, and the dynamics can be approximated using balanced models, which filter out the fast waves completely. The separation is not complete, however: The evolution of well-balanced flows inevitably leads to the excitation of inertia-gravity waves through the process of spontaneous generation. Spontaneous generation has fundamental and practical implications: It limits the validity of balanced models and provides a source of inertia-gravity-wave activity. These two aspects are discussed in this review, which focuses on the small-Rossby-number regime Œµ‚â™1 corresponding to strong rotation. Theoretical arguments indicate that spontaneous generation is then exponentially small in Œµ for smooth flows. They are complemented by numerical simulations that identify specific generation mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the general objective of pursuing oceanographic process and data assimilation studies of the complex, nonlinear eddy and jet current fields observed over the continental shelf and slope off the west coast of the United States, we investigate the use of intermediate models for that purpose. Intermediate models contain physics between that in the primitive equations and that in the quasigeostrophic equations and are capable of representing subinertial frequency motion over the O(1) topographic variations typical of the continental slope, while filtering out high-frequency gravity-inertial waves. As an initial step, we compare and evaluate several intermediate models applied to the f-plane shallow-water equations for flows over topography. The accuracy and utility of the intermediate models are assessed by a comparison of exact analytical and numerical solutions with those of the primitive shallow-water equations (SWE) and with those of the quasi-geostrophic equations (QG). The intermediate models that we consider are based on the geostrophic momentum (GM) approximation, the derivation of Salmon (1983) utilizing Hamilton's principle (HP), a geostrophic vorticity (GV) approximation, the quasi-geostrophic momentum and full continuity equations (IM), the linear balance equations (LBE), the balance equations (BE), the related balance-type (HBE, BEM, NBE) and modified linear balance equations (LQBE), the slow equations (SE) of Lynch (1989), and the modified slow equations (MSE). In Part I, we discuss the intermediate models and develop formulations that are suitable for numerical solution in physical coordinates for use in Parts II and III. We investigate the capability of the intermediate models to represent linear ageostrophic coastally trapped waves, i.e., Kelvin and continental shelf waves, and demonstrate that they do so with accuracy consistent with standard linear low-frequency approximations. We also assess the accuracy of the models by a comparison of exact nonlinear analytical solutions to the SWE for steady flow in an elliptic paraboloid and for unsteady motion of elliptical vortices in a circular paraboloid with corresponding analytical solutions to the intermediate models and to QG. General results from the exact solution comparisons include the following. Many of the intermediate models are capable of producing more accurate solutions than QG over a range of Rossby numbers 0 {\textless} Œµ {\textless} 1. In some cases, the intermediate models provide accurate approximate solutions where QG is not applicable and fails to give a relevant solution. Considerable parameter-dependent variation in quality exists, however, among the different intermediate models. For the particular problems considered here, BE, HBE, BEM, NBE, and MSE reproduce the exact results of the SWE while LBE and LQBE give the same approximation as QG. The accuracy of the models is typically in the order GV, GM, IM, HP, and QG, with GV most accurate and IM and HP sometimes less accurate than QG.},

These hierarchies are partial derivative (N)gamma/partial derivativet(N) = partial derivative (N+1)gamma/partial derivativet(N+1) = 0 (delta balance), partial derivative (N)delta/partial derivativet(N) = partial derivative (N)gamma/partial derivativet(N) = 0 (delta-gamma balance), and partial derivative (N)gamma/partial derivativet(N) = partial derivative (N+1)gamma/partial derivativet(N+1) = 0 (gamma balance), for N = 0, 1,.... How well these balance conditions represent the balance accessible to a given PE flow is explored. Detailed numerical experiments are carried out on an idealized potential vorticity distribution for which the domain maximum Rossby and Froude numbers are Ro(max) (=) over dot 0.73 and Fr-max (=) over dot 0.28. The numerical results reveal that all these hierarchies are asymptotic: as N increases, imbalance first decreases and then increases, as measured for instance by a linearized available energy. The minimum imbalance, over all the balance conditions considered, is attained by gamma balance at N = 2. The most accurate balance conditions (e.g., gamma and delta balances at N 5 2) all exhibit slightly different energy spectra for the imbalance at medium to largest scales. Further, the greatest improvement shown by these accurate balance conditions over the less accurate conditions like quasigeostrophy occurs at large scales.},

	abstract = {We investigate the route to dissipation in strongly stratified and rotating systems through high-resolution numerical simulations of the Boussinesq equations (BQs) and the primitive equations (PEs) in a triply periodic domain forced at large scales. By applying geostrophic scaling to the BQs and using the same horizontal length scale in defining the Rossby and the Froude numbers, RoRo{\textbackslash}mathit\{Ro\} and FrFr{\textbackslash}mathit\{Fr\}, we show that the PEs can be obtained from the BQs by taking the limit Fr2/Ro2‚Üí0Fr2/Ro2‚Üí0\{{\textbackslash}mathit\{Fr\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} / \{{\textbackslash}mathit\{Ro\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} {\textbackslash}rightarrow 0. When Fr2/Ro2Fr2/Ro2\{{\textbackslash}mathit\{Fr\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\} / \{{\textbackslash}mathit\{Ro\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}  is small the difference between the results from the BQ and the PE simulations is shown to be small. For large rotation rates, quasi-geostrophic dynamics are recovered with a forward enstrophy cascade and an inverse energy cascade. As the rotation rate is reduced, a fraction of the energy starts to cascade towards smaller scales, leading to a shallowing of the horizontal spectra from ùëò‚àí3‚Ñékh‚àí3\{ k\}\_\{h\}{\textasciicircum}\{- 3\}  to ùëò‚àí5/3‚Ñékh‚àí5/3\{ k\}\_\{h\}{\textasciicircum}\{- 5/ 3\}  at the small-scale end. The vertical spectra show a similar transition as the horizontal spectra and we find that Charney isotropy is approximately valid also at larger wavenumbers than the transition wavenumber. The high resolutions employed allow us to capture both ranges within the same simulation. At the transition scale, kinetic energy in the rotational and in the horizontally divergent modes attain comparable values. The divergent energy is several orders of magnitude larger than the quasi-geostrophic divergent energy given by the Œ©Œ©{\textbackslash}Omega -equation. The amount of energy cascading downscale is mainly controlled by the rotation rate, with a weaker dependence on the stratification. A larger degree of stratification favours a downscale energy cascade. For intermediate degrees of rotation and stratification, a constant energy flux and a constant enstrophy flux coexist within the same range of scales. In this range, the enstrophy flux is a result of triad interactions involving three geostrophic modes, while the energy flux is a result of triad interactions involving at least one ageostrophic mode, with a dominant contribution from interactions involving two ageostrophic and one geostrophic mode. Dividing the ageostrophic motions into two classes depending on the sign of the linear wave frequency, we show that the energy transfer is for the largest part supported by interactions within the same class, ruling out the wave‚Äìwave‚Äìvortex resonant triad interaction as a mean of the downscale energy transfer. The role of inertia-gravity waves is studied through analyses of time-frequency spectra of single Fourier modes. At large scales, distinct peaks at frequencies predicted for linear waves are observed, whereas at small scales no clear wave activity is observed. Triad interactions show a behaviour which is consistent with turbulent dynamics, with a large exchange of energy in triads with one small and two large comparable wavenumbers. The exchange of energy is mainly between the modes with two comparable wavenumbers.},

The specific properties of wave turbulence, induced by wave-wave interactions and breaking, are illustrated by comparative studies of oceanic and atmospheric observations, as well as laboratory and numerical experiments.
